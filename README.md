# Flutter Firebase Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Flutter Firebase Tic-Tac-Toe project! This project aims to create a fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in two modes: Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Computer.

## Project Overview

- **Game Modes:**
  - **PvP Mode:** Allows two players to play against each other on separate devices, with moves synchronized through Firebase Realtime Database.
  - **Player vs. Computer Mode:** Enables a single player to challenge an AI opponent (the computer) with various difficulty levels.

- **Firebase Integration:**
  - Firebase is used for real-time multiplayer gameplay. It manages game state, player authentication, and move synchronization.
  - Firebase Authentication: Players can sign in or create accounts to play online.
  - Firebase Realtime Database: Stores game state and ensures synchronized gameplay between devices.

- **User Interface (UI):**
  - Create an engaging and intuitive UI with Flutter to display the game board and interactive elements.
  - Implement user authentication screens for account creation and login.

- **AI Opponent:**
  - Develop an AI opponent for Player vs. Computer mode. You can use various algorithms, such as Minimax, to create a challenging computer player.
